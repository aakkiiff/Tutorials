### Step 1: Generate SSH Key Pair
Open a terminal on your local machine and run the following command:\
`ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048`

### Step 2: Copy Public Key to Remote Host
Assuming your remote host is running a Unix-like operating system, you can use the ssh-copy-id command to copy your public key to the remote host. Replace "username" and "hostname" with your actual remote username and hostname/IP.\
`ssh-copy-id username@hostname`\

This command adds your public key to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the remote host.

### Step 3: Test SSH Connection
Try to SSH into the remote host\
`ssh username@hostname`

### Step 4: Optional - Create SSH Config File
To simplify connections, you can create an SSH config file (~/.ssh/config) on your local machine. Edit the file with a text editor.\
`vim ~/.ssh/config`

Add the following lines, replacing "hostname" with your remote host's address and "key" with the path to your private key.\

```
Host myhost
  HostName hostname/ip
  User username
  Port 5439
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/key

```
### Step 5: Connect Using SSH Config
Now you can connect to your remote host using the configured alias:\
`ssh myhost`
