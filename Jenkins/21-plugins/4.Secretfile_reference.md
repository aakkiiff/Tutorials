# application.properties file via jenkins
**required plugin is already installed at boot time**
## confgure
1. make a jenkins credential -> secretfile
2. upload file
3. give it a id which will be referred in the pipeline
4. make a pipeline


```
pipeline {
    agent any 
    tools {
        maven 'mvn'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Pull from GitLab and Build') {
            steps {
                cleanWs()
                git branch: 'main', url: 'https://gitlab.com/aesdevops/test_akif-properties'  
                withCredentials([file(credentialsId: 'testproperties', variable: 'test')]) {
                    sh "echo 'Contents of test file:'"
                    sh "cat \$test"
                    sh "mkdir -p ./src/main/resources/"
                    sh "cp \$test ./src/main/resources/application.properties"
                }                
            }
        }
        stage('Build Docker Image') {
            steps {
                sh "mvn clean package"
                sh "docker build -t test:1 ."
            }
        }
    }
}
```
5. first pull the src code
6. then we use the pipeline syntax "with credentials" to get the code to use the secret file from code
7. use the code in the pipeline
8. we need to copy the secret file to the resources directory
9. now copy the referenced variable to the resources directory as maven will build the java project which will look application.properties file in resources directory by default
10. build the code by maven and you are done
